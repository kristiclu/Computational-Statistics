Generators of RN (random numbers) in SAS
RANUNI (UNIFORM) function - gives us a number gnerated on uniform distribution on interval [0,1], 
it use generator with mod m=2^31-1 and a=39820409

First exercise
First task
By using seed = 1789 we want to generate a set of 100 pseudo-random numbers that follow an exponential 
distribution with a rate parameter of Î»=2. Save the generated data into a table (a SAS data set), and 
then display the distribution of the data using a histogram. 
(Instruction: Use PROC UNIVARIATE to display the histogram. Use SAS Help for reference.)

Next, calculate the descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) 
for the generated data.Finally, test the hypothesis that the data's distribution fits a theoretical
exponential distribution (goodness-of-fit test).Comment on your results (discuss the values of the 
descriptive statistics and the fit with the theoretical distribution).



Second task
Generate a sample of 200 pseudo-random numbers that follow a Bernoulli distribution with the given 
parameter value p=0.15. Calculate the descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for 
the generated data. Using the FREQ procedure, print a frequency table. Use a seed of 81434.
